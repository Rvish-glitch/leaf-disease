# Deprecated Files (Docker Migration)

The following files are no longer needed since we migrated to Docker deployment:

## Backend (./backend/)
- `nixpacks.toml` - Replaced by `Dockerfile`
- `Procfile` - Replaced by Docker CMD in `Dockerfile`  
- `runtime.txt` - Python version specified in `Dockerfile`
- `start.sh` - Functionality moved to `Dockerfile`

## Root Directory
- Old nixpacks configuration has been replaced with Docker configuration

## What to keep:
- `railway.toml` and `backend/railway.json` - Updated for Docker deployment
- All application code files
- `requirements.txt` and `package.json` - Still needed for Docker builds

## Migration complete:
✅ Docker deployment ready
✅ Railway configured for Docker  
✅ Local development with docker-compose
✅ Production deployment options

You can safely remove the deprecated files if desired, but they don't interfere with Docker deployment.
